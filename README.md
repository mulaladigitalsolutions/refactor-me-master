# Refactor Me: 

## Expectation:

Improve the code through a refactoring exercise.
Extend the unit tests if necessary.
Extend the solution if necessary.

*Please **zip** the completed exercise and send it to the HR representative handling your application.*

## Tips:
Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code to improve its internal structure and design without altering its external behavior or functionality.

Think about how we can use software design principles and patterns to improve the code base.
